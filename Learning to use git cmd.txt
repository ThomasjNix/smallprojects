I cloned this repository from GitHub to practice use of Git Shell, git commands in a command line.

mkdir <folder_name>- creates a path at the current directory of <folder_name>
clone <URL> - clones the repository at the folder
status - checks status of current repository
add <file_name> or add<*> - adds the currently modified file or all files to the staging area from the working directory
commit -m "commit message" - Commits to the master branch with the message provided.
